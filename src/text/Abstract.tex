\chapter{Abstract}

Agent-based models have proven to be a useful tool to study complex social phenomena.
In this work we have developed a simulation using an agent-based model of a virtual
classroom, simulating the behavior of students and adolescents in an autonomous
study group. The agent cognition is based on the widely used Big-Five personality
trait model, and agent behavior has been aligned with empirical studies showing
how specific personality traits correlate with academic success. The simulation
software was used to compare how different classroom compositions with an increasing
ratio of students with Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prototypical
personality traits affect the classroom dynamics. We found a very strong effect
of ADHD students on the mean classroom happiness and attention. Even a very small
number of ADHD students can cause a shift in the behavior of None-ADHD students,
decreasing their mean happiness and attention, in addition to more frequent classroom
wide quarrels.
